# Scoring-Protein-Backbone
Project Goal: "Score protein backbone based on Ramachandran angle preferences, using phi/psi angles to assess steric plausibility of protein structures.It includes a StremLit app for quick visualization and evaluation."

Feature:
1. Parse PDB files using Biopython
2. Calculate phi/psi angles
3. Scores based on allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot
4. Simple web interface built in StreamLit

Note: 
I bult this program with the guidance and coding support from ChatGPT.
